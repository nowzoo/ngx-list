The base library is agnostic as to styling and controls; a full set of Bootstrap 4 controls is available as a separate module.\nQuick Start\nInstall the library and Lodash.\nbash\nnpm i -S @nowzoo/ngx-list lodash\nProblem with depending on Lodash? Read this note.\nIf you are planning on using the Bootstrap 4 components, you need to include Bootstrap css somewhere in your build process. None of the Bootstrap components depend on Bootstrap javascript.\nBasic Usage\nThe base library does not expose any components or services, so there's no module to import. There's just the NgxList class that you import and instantiate in your component code...\n```ts\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NgxList, NgxListResult } from '@nowzoo/ngx-list';\nimport { MyDataService } from '../my-data.service';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-demo',\n  templateUrl: './demo.component.html',\n  styles: []\n})\nexport class DemoComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n  list: NgxList;\n  result: NgxListResult = null;\n  constructor(\n    private dataService: MyDataService\n  ) { }\n  ngOnInit() {\n    // assuming dataService.data$ is an observable\n    // of an array of records\n    this.list = new NgxList({\n      src$: this.dataService.data$, //required\n      idKey: 'id' //required\n    });\n    this.list.results$.subscribe(result => this.result = result);\n  }\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    this.list.destroy();\n  }\n}\n```\n```html\n\n{{result | json}}\n```\nResult:\njson\n{\n  \"page\": 0,\n  \"recordsPerPage\": 10,\n  \"sort\": {\n    \"key\": \"id\",\n    \"reversed\": false\n  },\n  \"filterValues\": {},\n  \"recordCount\": 88,\n  \"pageCount\": 9,\n  \"unfilteredRecordCount\": 88,\n  \"records\": [...]\n}\nAt this point, result.records is the array of sorted and filtered records from your src$ observable that belong on the current page.\nIt's up to you to layout the records, for example in a table...\n```html\n\n      ...\n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n```\n\nSetting list params\nNote: In the real world you'll probably want to hook the list parameters up to form controls, or use the Bootstrap components.\nSet page...\nts\n// Go to the second page (page is zero-based.)\nthis.list.setPage(1);\nSet recordsPerPage...\nts\nthis.list.setRecordsPerPage(20);\n// show all the records, with no paging...\nthis.list.setRecordsPerPage(0);\nSet sort...\nts\nthis.list.setSort({key: 'firstName', reversed: false});\nSet a filter value.  Note that you have to actually set up the filter when you instantiate the list. See below.\nts\nthis.list.setFilterValue('search' 'foo');\nConstructor options\nThe NgxList constructor takes an object. The only required properties are:\n\nsrc$: Observable The records from your data source.\nidKey: string The key of some unique record identifier. This is used as the fallback sort key.\n\nOptional properties:\n\npage: number\nrecordsPerPage: number\nsort: {key: string, reversed: boolean}\nfilterValues: {[filterKey: string]: any} The initial values for the filters. For example, you could pass {search: 'foo'} if initializing the list from a query param.\nfilters: {[filterKey: string]: NgxListFilterFn} Your filter functions. You can roll your own or use the NgxList factories, NgxList.searchFilter (for text searches) and NgxList.comparisonFilter.\nsortFn: NgxListSortFn You can roll your own function here, use the NgxList.sortFn factory. If nothing is passed, the list creates a sort function with some sensible defaults.\n\nAPI\nTypes\ntype NgxListColumnValueFn = (record: any) => any\nA function that, given a record, returns a value for purposes of sorting, search or filtering. Used by the factory functions.\ntype NgxListFilterFn = (records: any[], value: any) => any[]\nThe signature of a filter function. You should return a new array of records that match your filter logic. (Don't mutate the array passed in the parameter.)\n\nrecords contains the unfiltered records.\nvalue is the current filter value.\n\ntype NgxListSortFn = (records: any[], key: string) => any[]\nThe signature of a sort function. You should return a separate array sorted by your logic. (Don't mutate the array passed in the parameter.)\n\nrecords are the unsorted records.\nkey is the sort key.\n\nNote that reversing the list, if necessary, happens separately.\nEnums\nenum NgxListCompare\nUsed by the NgxList.comparisonFilter factory.\n- eq Use ===  to compare values.\n- neq Use !==  to compare values.\n- gte Use >=  to compare values.\n- gt Use '>'  to compare values.\n- lte Use   to compare values.\n- lt Use '\nInterfaces\ninterface NgxListInit\nOptions passed to the NgxList constructor.\n\nsrc$: Observable Required. The records from your data source.\nidKey: string Required The key of some unique record identifier. This is used as the fallback sort key.\npage?: number Optional. The initial page. Default 0.\nrecordsPerPage?: number Optional. The initial recordsPerPage. Default 10.\nsort?: {key?: string, reversed?: boolean} Optional. The initial sort. Defaults to {key: THE_ID_KEY_PASSED_ABOVE,  reversed: false}\nfilterValues?: {[filterKey: string]: any} Optional. The initial values for the filters. For example, you could pass {search: 'foo'} if initializing the list from a query param.\nfilters?: {[filterKey: string]: NgxListFilterFn} Optional. Your filter functions. You can roll your own or use the NgxList factories, NgxList.searchFilter (for text searches) and NgxList.comparisonFilter.\nsortFn?: NgxListSortFn Optional. If nothing is passed, the list creates a sort function with some sensible defaults. You can roll your own sort function, use the NgxList.sortFn factory.\n\ninterface NgxListResult\nThe end product of the list.\nNotes\nAbout the Lodash dependency\nYeah, yeah, I know you can do everything Lodash does natively. But you can't do it as well or as consistently. So, Lodash.\nThe library uses a minimal set of Lodash functions, which will add about 7.5kB to the payload of your app, if you don't use other Lodash functions elsewhere. If you do use it elsewhere, make sure to use the following tree-shakeable import syntax:\nts\n// good\nimport chunk from 'lodash/chunk';\nimport sortBy from 'lodash/sortBy';\n// bad\n// import * as _ from 'lodash';\n// just as bad...\n// import { chunk, sortBy } from 'lodash';\nTo make this compile for your code, you will probably have to add \"esModuleInterop\": true, \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true  to compilerOptions in tsconfig.json. (You don't need to add it if you are not using Lodash elsewhere, only using the ngx-list library.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2019 NowZoo\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
